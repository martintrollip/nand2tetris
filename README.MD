## Introduction
This is some notes and designs for my work on the [nand2tetris course](http://www.nand2tetris.org/). The objective is to build a Modern Computer from First Principles. 

## Code Posting Policy
The [nand2tetris terms](http://www.nand2tetris.org/terms.php) prohibits the posing of original work and solutions online, in order to aid self-discovery for other learners. For this reason, no complete solution will be posted here, but perhaps a comment or observation will point someone in the right direction.  The repository is used as evidence for my work and progression through the course. 

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken and the rest of the [nand2tetris team](http://www.nand2tetris.org/team.php). Be sure to check out the course and if you're up for the challenge trying it yourself.
